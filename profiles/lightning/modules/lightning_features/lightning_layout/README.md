## Lightning Layout
Lightning Media provides modules and configuration for great media authoring
experiences. By default, it is automatically installed when using the Lightning
Distribution, although you have the option to turn it off during installation.

It is possible to use the Lightning Layout module outside of the Lightning
Distribution, although it is not recommended.

## Stand-alone installation
Use the following instructions to install Lightning Layout outside of the
Lightning Distribution or on an existing site:

// @todo provide a separate makefile here that is identical to the media
// section of the Lightning Distro make file

## Upgrading
